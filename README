Introduction

The SERSCIS Access Modeller (SAM) takes a model of a system (e.g. a set of objects
within a computer program or a set of machines on a network) and attempts to verify
certain security properties about the system, by exploring all the ways access can
propagate through the system.

It is designed to handle dynamic systems (e.g. systems containing factories
which may create new objects at runtime) and systems where behaviour of some
of the objects is unknown or not trusted.

A typical approach is to model a system initially with most objects having
defined (trusted) behaviour, and then to explore the effects of making them
undefined or of adding additional actors with undefined behaviour into the system.
